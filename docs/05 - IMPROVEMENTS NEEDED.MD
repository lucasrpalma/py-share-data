# Improvements needed
- TLS
- Better authentication, as:
  - Strong authentication protocol implementation (like OAUTH2)
  - Better token management (incuding expiration)
  - Better cryptographic algorithms (maybe PBKDF2 instead of SHA512)
- More user management features, as:
  - User registration
  - Password recovery
  - Change password
  - MFA
  - Check for weak password
- Feature against brute force, as:
  - Block the user and/or the IP after a few tries
  - Throttling on the requests
- Requests through WAF and firewall overall
- CI/CD with SAST, SCA, DAST and other security controls
- Better logging (including using **logging** instead of **print**)
- Docker image hardening
- External secrets service usage instead of hardcoded passwords
- Check for long inputs trying to make a DoS
- Better testing against concurrency issues
- Better error handling
- Unit and integrations tests
